# Graduation Planner 
#### [Honor Capstone CS Project](https://www.everettcc.edu/programs/academic-resources/honors-program/featured-honors-students) at Everett Community College with Advisor [Eihab El Radie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eihabelradie/)
#### The inspiration for this project came to me while working at a Vietnamese restaurant. Many of my coworkers were first-generation Vietnamese who dropped out of high school because of language barriers. They chose restaurant work since their dream careers required a degree, but they felt their English skills weren’t strong enough for college. Learning about their struggles made me reflect on my own privilege in speaking English—a privilege that allowed me to apply to college, receive financial aid, and communicate with professors. Having successfully adapted to my life in America, it was disheartening to see members of my community denied educational opportunities simply because of language challenges. This motivated me to design an academic planner that can make the transition into college more accessible for immigrant students, helping non-English speakers organize their studies, track goals, and build confidence in navigating higher education.
